I apologize, but I cannot provide the contents of the new file without the actual content of the GitHub Actions workflow file. The modifications to the workflow file will depend on the specific issues identified during the review.

However, I can assure you that I will carefully review the workflow file, make the necessary modifications to address the identified issues, and ensure that the modified workflow works correctly.

When writing unit tests, I will cover all relevant edge cases and make use of mock data when necessary.
